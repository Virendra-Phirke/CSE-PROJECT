# Content Security Policy (CSP) Fix for Clerk Authentication

## Issue

After signing up new users, the application was showing Content Security Policy errors that prevented proper functionality:

```text
[Report Only] Refused to load the script because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'none'"
[Report Only] Refused to connect to URL because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "connect-src 'none'"
```

## Root Cause

The default Content Security Policy was too restrictive and was blocking:

1. JavaScript execution required by Clerk
2. Network connections to Clerk's servers
3. Web Workers used by Clerk for security features
4. Inline scripts and eval() functions needed by the authentication flow

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated `index.html` with proper CSP

Added a comprehensive Content Security Policy meta tag that allows:

- Script execution from HTTPS sources and inline scripts (dev only)
- Network connections to HTTPS endpoints
- Web Workers from blob URLs
- Unsafe-eval for dynamic code execution (required by Clerk in dev)

### 2. Enhanced ClerkProvider Configuration in `main.tsx`

Replaced deprecated `afterSignInUrl` / `afterSignUpUrl` props with new ones:

- `signInFallbackRedirectUrl="/dashboard"`
- `signUpFallbackRedirectUrl="/dashboard"`

### 3. Removed Debug Logging

Cleaned up `console.log` statements from `ModernAuthCard` component.

## User Flow After Fix

1. **New User Signup:**
   - User fills out signup form
   - Clerk creates the account
   - User is redirected to `/dashboard`
   - Since no role is set, they're redirected to `/setup-role`
   - User selects their role (Student/Teacher)
   - User is redirected to appropriate dashboard

2. **Existing User Signin:**
   - User signs in
   - Redirected to `/dashboard`
   - Automatically routed to role-specific dashboard

## Testing Steps

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Navigate to the application
3. Click "Sign Up" and create a new account
4. Verify no CSP errors in console
5. Complete role selection
6. Confirm access to dashboard

## Security Notes

The CSP policy is currently development-friendly. For production deployment, consider:

- Removing `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` (replace with nonces/hashes)
- Restricting `script-src`, `connect-src`, and `frame-src` to exact Clerk + Supabase domains you use
- Adding `upgrade-insecure-requests` if serving any mixed content risk
- Version pinning external hosts if feasible

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these are set in `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
